- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who wants to cooperate with me)
- 📫 How to reach me: yes, easily, for example, via e-mail: rkvnluz@yandex.ru
- 😄 Pronouns: and I do not know what to write here. No, seriously, what do you need here?
- ⚡ Fun fact: my friend and I are making a website, and we don't buy a place on the host server, but we made a server out of his computer. As a result, the site will work 12 hours a day.
